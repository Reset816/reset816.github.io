I obtained a bachelor's degree in computer science from Lanzhou University in 2023, under the guidance of Associate Professor [Xin Liu (刘新)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=F6csWYQAAAAJ&hlu).

I ventured into the field of security halfway through. Moreover, I am also intrigued by system research, especially the kernel and related areas.

The experience gained from my recent [Linux kernel trimming project](/#-projects) sparked my curiosity about Linux kernel.

My research interest includes kernel, cyber security, as well as performance analysis and tuning.
